THIS CAR GEAR INDICATOR IS MY ENHANCEMENT FROM PREVIOUS PROJECT THAT ONLY USING 7 SEGMENT DISPLAY WHICH VERY EFFECTIVE & EFICIENT BUT THERE COME WITH LIMITATIONS.
Here The Car Gear indicator is for manual transmission car / 5 speed N-12345-R gear / H patern gear shift.
This project is simple utilizing Arduino Uno R3.
Same as previous project, for input i using 7 hall effect sensors A3144.
Here the display utilizing a MAX7219 chip to drive 8x8 MATRIX LED DISPLAY.

Here i already put the base for you to modify as you like.
